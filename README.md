🎧 Audio Dojo

Audio Dojo is a web-based training platform for developing critical listening skills through interactive audio quizzes.
The app focuses on ear training for audio processing concepts (starting with EQ), using real sound examples, immediate feedback, and clear performance summaries.

Live demo: https://audiodojo.netlify.app

✨ Key Features

🎵 Audio-based quizzes – questions built around real sound examples

🎚 Critical listening training – identify frequencies, boosts/cuts, and processing changes

⚡ Instant feedback – correct / incorrect responses with visual and textual cues

📊 Final summary report – score calculation and session overview

🕘 Attempt history – review past quiz attempts (stored locally)

📱 Responsive UI – optimized for desktop and mobile

🛠 Tech Stack

React – UI and component architecture

Vite – fast development and build tooling

JavaScript (ES6+)

Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling

Firebase – data storage and configuration

LocalStorage – session history persistence

Netlify – deployment and hosting

🧠 Architecture Overview

Modular quiz engine based on question templates (JSON)

Separation between:

Process Setup (what to train)

Quiz Setup (how the quiz behaves)

Dynamic question generation based on selected parameters

Stateless UI components with shared global state via context

No user accounts in MVP (lightweight, frictionless usage)
